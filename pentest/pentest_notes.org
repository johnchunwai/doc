* how to share files between linux machines or ssh into linux machine
1) set up and run sshd on one machine
   - make sure openssh is installed if not
   - vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config if needed
     - allow only Protocol 2
     - comment out the HostKeys that are not needed, I use only rsa
     - turn on StrictModes for more security
     - disable PermitRootLogin to make things more secure
     - optionally enable client cert authentication by uncommenting
       AutherizedKeysFile
     - disable PasswordAuthentication for security
   - generate host key if not already done
     - ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
   - start or restart sshd:
     - ubuntu based# service ssh start/restart
     - other# /etc/init.d/sshd start/restart

2) set up client side auth keys
   - ssh-keygen -t rsa (this generates 2 keys id_rsa private key and
     id_rsa.pub public key)
   - copy the keys to ~/.ssh/ folder (or already in there)
   - if cygwin# chgrp -Rv User ~/.ssh
   - chmod 700 ~/.ssh
   - chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   - copy id_rsa.pub to sshd host machine's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (~/
     is the user's home folder) file (or copy & paste the new .pub
     content and append to that file). The file path depends on the
     AutherizedKeysFile settings.
   - restart sshd (not sure if this is needed)

3) copy files between the 2 machines using scp
   - <user_name>@<host>: can be omitted for the local machine)
   - scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa <user_name>@<src_host>:<src_file> <user_name>@<dst_host>:<dst_file>
   - remember to shop sshd afterwards

4) to ssh into linux machine, same command
   - ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa <user_name>@<host>

** Troubleshooting
- tail -f /var/log/auth.log

** A different approach
1) copy the file that you want to share into /var/www/ directory
2) make sure to chmod to 644
3) # service apache2 start
4) on the other machine use a browser to http://<hostname>/<file> to
   download the file
5) remember to stop apache2 afterwards

* Getting all endpoints
** PC
1) Run sysinternals procmon
2) Click toolbar buttons to only "show network activities"
3) launch the game
3) Drag the "target" from toolbar to the game
4) run the game till we're in fut
5) in procmon -> file -> save... make sure events displayed using
   current filter, format csv, and save to a file
6) open in excel and clean up, remove duplicates to reveal all the
   endpoints
7) if only ip's are shown and no hostname, use wireshark to find out

If http protocol issue, use double proxy, otherwise use single proxy

* double proxy (limit to a single endpoint)
Game client -> Fiddler -> Burp -> UTAS
1) user.ini points to utas.gt.fut.ea.com:8314, force non secure under
   [FUT] (and also [ONLINE] for 360)
1) Fiddler -> Tools -> Fiddler Options -> Connections, set listens on
   port to 8314
2) on Gateway tab, "Use System Proxy (recommended)
3) Fiddler -> Rules -> Customize Rules...
4) Add this:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
    static function OnBeforeRequest(oSession: Session) {
	if (oSession.host.toLowerCase() == "utas.gt.fut.ea.com:8314") { // FUT HOST:PORT
		oSession.host = "10.10.68.32:8314";  // BURP IP:PORT
	}
#+END_SRC
5) [@5]Fiddler: start capture
6) Modify c:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts:
	127.0.0.1       utas.gt.fut.ea.com
7) Start backtrack and Burp (Applications -> BackTrack ->
   Vulnerability Assessment -> Web Application Assessment -> Web
   Application Proxies -> burpsuite)
8) Proxy tab:
   1) Intercept tab -> off
   2) Options tab:
      1) Proxy Listeners [running, backtrack ip:8314, invisible,
         redirect: utas.gt.fut.ea.com:8314]
   3) History tab to watch
9) Start fifa game and connect to fut

* double proxy 2 (infinite endpoints)
Game client -> Charles web debugging proxy -> Burp UTAS
1) same user.ini change
2) update etc/hosts to point all interesting endpoints to localhost
2) charles -> proxy -> reverse proxies
3) add (double click to edit), local port=the endpoint port, remote
   host:port=burp host:port, don't rewrite redirects, check Preserve
   Host Header
4) do the burp set up for each endpoint

* single proxy
Game client -> Burp -> UTAS
1) No fiddler
2) user.ini points to burp host:port for FUT

* intercepting binary traffic (PC)
hookme (freeware)
1) File -> open/attach to fifaz.exe
2) Turn intercept on/off
3) Set rules to Match and replace without the need to intercept

## Create a VPN server on PC
http://www.howtogeek.com/135996/how-to-create-a-vpn-server-on-your-windows-computer-without-installing-any-software/
How to Create a VPN Server on Your Windows Computer Without Installing Any Software
Windows has the built-in ability to function as VPN server, although this option is hidden. This trick works on both Windows 7 and Windows 8. The server uses the point-to-point tunneling protocol (PPTP.)

This could be useful for connecting to your home network on the road, playing LAN games with someone, or securing your web browsing on a public Wi-Fi connection – a few of the many reasons you might want to use a VPN.

Limitations
While this is a pretty interesting feature, it may not be the ideal way to allow VPN connections to your local network. It has some limitations:

You will need the ability to forward ports from your router.
You have to expose Windows and a port for the PPTP VPN server directly to the Internet, which is not ideal from a security standpoint. You should use a strong password and consider using a port that isn’t the default port.
This isn’t as easy to set up and use as software like LogMeIn Hamachi and TeamViewer. Most people will probably be better off with a more complete software package like those two.
Creating a VPN Server
First, you’ll need to open the Network Connections window. The quickest way to open it is to press the Windows key, type ncpa.cpl, and press Enter.

Press the Alt key, click the File menu that appears, and select New Incoming Connection.

You can now select the user accounts that can connect remotely. To increase security, you may want to create a new, limited user account rather than allow VPN logins from your primary user account. (Click Add someone to create a new user account.) Ensure the user you allow has a very strong password, as a weak password could be cracked by a dictionary attack.

Select the Through the Internet option to allow VPN connections over the Internet. You can also allow incoming connections over a dial-up modem, if you have the dial-up hardware.

You can then select the networking protocols that should be enabled for incoming connections. For example, if you don’t want people connected to the VPN to have access to shared files and printers on your local network, you can uncheck the File and Printer Sharing option.

Click the Allow access button and Windows will set up a VPN server.

If you want to disable the VPN server in the future, you can delete the Incoming Connections item from your Network Connections window.

Router Setup
You will now need to log into your router’s setup page and forward port 1723 to the IP address of the computer where you set up the VPN server. For more instructions, read How to Forward Ports on Your Router.

For maximum security, you may want to create a port forwarding rule that forwards a random “external port” – such as 23243 – to “internal port” 1723 on your computer. This will allow you to connect to the VPN server using port 23243, and will protect you from malicious programs that scan and attempt to automatically connect to VPN servers running on the default port.

You can also consider using a router or firewall to only allow incoming connections from specific IP addresses.

To ensure you can always connect to the VPN server, you may want to set up a dynamic DNS service like DynDNS on your router.

Connecting to Your VPN Server
To connect to the VPN server, you will need your computer’s public IP address (its IP address on the Internet) or its dynamic DNS address, if you set up a dynamic DNS service above.

Use the Connect to a network option in Windows and enter your computer’s public IP address. Provide the username and password you created to log in.

For more instructions on connecting, read How to Connect to a VPN on Windows.
