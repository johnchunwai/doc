* Intro
- tmux provides n-2-n mapping between shells and terminals
- Eg.
  - 2 tmux sessions A and B
    - in A, have 2 shells, one running emacs, one running vim
    - in B, have 1 shell running zsh
    - have 1 terminal attached to tmux session A
      - this terminal can control either of the shells by swapping windows (tabs) or panes
    - have 2 terminals attached to tmux session B
      - this causes the 2 terminals to mirror each other
      - can be used for pair programming etc.
